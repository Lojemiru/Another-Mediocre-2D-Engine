#region Design Notes

/*
 * Originally, this class managed a list of Actors and required each Actor to be manually registered with it.
 *      Now that Actors are managed per-layer, it only has to directly oversee persistent Actors and offer a few
 *      helper functions.
 *
 * Now it's doing almost nothing lol, made more sense to make things static within Actor itself.
